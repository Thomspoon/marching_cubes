# Building

Create a build folder and run cmake (optionally specifying whatever compiler you want as long as it supports C++17):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

# Running

The program should be available under the `src` folder in the build directory.

Use WASD to move around, and mouse to look around.
