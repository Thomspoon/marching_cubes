# Building

Create a build folder and run cmake (optionally specifying whatever compiler you want as long as it supports C++17):

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

# Running

The program should be available under the `src` folder in the build directory.

Use WASD to move around, and mouse to look around.

Bonus:
  O - turn off point-grid
  P - turn on point-grid
  E - turn on wire-frame
  Q - turn off wireframe

Press ESC to get mouse access to close the window.
